### Disclaimer: 📝
This project does not claim ownership of the dataset. It is being used solely for educational purposes and for the development of machine learning models. 🚀

### Model Performance 📊:
The CNN model trained on this dataset was able to achieve a **training accuracy of ~80%**. However, the **validation accuracy fluctuated between 69-79%**, indicating that there is room for improvement. 📈 This may be due to overfitting or the need for further hyperparameter tuning, additional data, or more advanced techniques such as transfer learning.

While the current results are promising 💡, the model's performance can still be improved by experimenting with different model architectures, increasing the dataset size 📂, or using techniques like data augmentation and regularization to better generalize to unseen data. ✨
